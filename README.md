# CS50P_WEEK8_OOP
This is week8 of the CS50P which was about the Object oriented programming, this repo contains the project files that i have designed to implement the theoretical knowledge
This week's projects focus on various tasks including calculating age in minutes, implementing a cookie jar class, and creating a customized PDF certificate using fpdf2. Let's explore each project in detail:

---

#### 1. Age in Minutes Calculator

In `seasons.py`, the program prompts the user for their date of birth and calculates their age in minutes. It utilizes the `datetime` module to handle date and time-related operations, converting the age to words using the `inflect` library. The result is rounded to the nearest integer and displayed in English words.

#### 2. Cookie Jar Implementation

The `jar.py` file contains a class called `Jar` representing a cookie jar. The class has methods to initialize the jar with a given capacity, deposit cookies, withdraw cookies, and retrieve the current capacity and size of the jar. The implementation ensures that the jar's capacity is not exceeded during deposit and withdrawal operations.

#### 3. CS50 Shirtificate Generator

In `shirtificate.py`, the program generates a customized PDF certificate called "Shirtificate" using the `fpdf2` library. It prompts the user for their name and creates a PDF certificate with the CS50 logo centered horizontally, the user's name on top of the logo, and the text "CS50 Shirtificate" at the top of the page. The resulting PDF is saved as `shirtificate.pdf`.

These projects demonstrate proficiency in handling dates, implementing classes, and generating customized PDF documents using Python libraries.
